## Surface Urban Heat Island index

Surface Urban Heat Island Index was computed usign the following methodology:

$$
SUHIi = LST\_urban – LST\_mean\_rural
$$ {#eq-suhii} where

$LST\_urban$ pixels within the administrative perimeter of an urban area; urban pixels refer to artificial surfaces and associated areas;

$LST\_mean\_rural$ areal mean of non-urban pixels from the buffer extended up to ½ \* average distance between the city centroid and nodes of the urban administrative perimeter non-urban pixels refer to any land cover category except for urban and water, and they define the rural area used for comparison with the urban pixels.

SUHIi computed from <a href="https://admin.climate.esa.int/media/documents/LST-CCI-D4.3-PUG_-_i2r0_-_Product_User_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">SENTINEL3x_SLSTR_L3C_0.01</a> for each day with data available for 41 cities in Romania.
